title: Zukini is back
---

I'd like to try something different. I've been making plant based food from home for nearly two years now. It's been a success but not from a financial point of view—more from what I have discovered about food and people.

On the new ZUKINI you will be able to read interviews with people who eat plant based food exclusively and my own personal thoughts on food, yoga, sustainability. I'll be providing a guide for what's good to buy in Leicester market. In addition you will be able to buy the food I make—see [Veggie Bite](../veggiebite.html). You can also hire my services to help you with figuring out plant based eating.
