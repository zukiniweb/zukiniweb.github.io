<h4 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you and what do you do?</h4>

<p>I’m Jess, a 25 year old Marine Biology graduate currently working in retail.</p>

<h4 id="how-long-have-you-been-eating-plant-based-foods-and-what-made-you-get-into-plant-foods">How long have you been eating plant based foods and what made you get into plant foods?</h4>

<p>Over the past few years I’ve been getting more and more into health and realised how diet is crucial to our well-being. Around October time in 2014 I stumbled across some vegan YouTube videos and was fascinated by how vibrant and happy these people were. So I did some more research, found out how beneficial a plant based lifestyle is, along with the horrors of the meat, egg and dairy industry, and went vegan the following month.</p>

<h4 id="do-you-like-making-food-and-what-are-your-favourite-foods">Do you like making food and what are your favourite foods?</h4>

<p>I love cooking! I’ve become so much more experimental with my food since starting this lifestyle. My favourite food has to be bananas, I eat them every day.</p>

<h4 id="describe-your-day-with-plant-foods">Describe your day with plant foods.</h4>

<p>Most mornings I have a big smoothie that is usually bananas, greens and some other fruits. Lunch I like to have a bowl of banana ice cream topped with berries, flaxseed etc. For dinner I’ll have anything I fancy, such as home made pizza, veggie burgers, stir-fries or lasagne.</p>

<h4 id="whats-your-favourite-kitchen-toolgadget">What’s your favourite kitchen tool/gadget?</h4>

<p>I have a three in one Kenwood that is a mixer, food processor and blender. It’s amazing.</p>

<h4 id="what-one-food-could-you-not-live-without-and-which-food-do-you-miss-the-most-since-switching-to-plant-based-foods">What one food could you not live without and which food do you miss the most since switching to plant based foods?</h4>

<p>I couldn’t live without my bananas. I don’t really miss any foods these days, although when I first transitioned I found cheese the only thing I really missed, but I found vegan alternatives and don’t crave it at all any more.</p>

<h4 id="what-do-you-consider-the-most-important-foods-in-your-diet-and-why">What do you consider the most important foods in your diet and why?</h4>

<p>I don’t consider any foods more important, a balance of different foods is most important to me.</p>

<h4 id="would-you-say-your-look-and-feel-more-healthy">Would you say your look and feel more healthy?</h4>

<p>Yes, I noticed within a week of transitioning that I felt more healthy and alive.</p>

<h4 id="how-has-eating-plant-foods-changed-you">How has eating plant foods changed you?</h4>

<p>It’s given me more energy, improved my mood and I feel much more aware of what I eat and where it has come from.</p>

<h4 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-someone-who-is-thinking-about-getting-into-plant-based-foods">What advice would you give to someone who is thinking about getting into plant based foods.</h4>

<p>Do your research and go for it! If you need advice there are so many people out there willing to help you!</p>

<!-- Load libraries -->

// Place scripts to be loaded here, in the order the need to be executed
// Typically libraries are needed first, such as jQuery (as the plugins

// Hammer uses, but customise this for your own needs.
// Notice the use of @path here. This is because we need the file names, 
// not the script tags being generated. Ensure all filenames you wish
// head.js to load are surrounded with quotes. Also, this is a list, so
// ensure that all but the last item are followed by a comma.
