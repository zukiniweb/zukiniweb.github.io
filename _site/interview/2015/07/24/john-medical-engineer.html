<h1 class="by">John is a Medical engineer—though bike trials is his love</h1> 
<h2 class="by"><i>by</i> rajiv 24 July 2015</h2>
<h4 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you">Who are you and what do you?</h4>

<p>My name is John and I work as a Medical engineer, although Bike trials (sport of riding a bike over obstacles) is my main love along with music and freediving (breath hold diving).</p>

<p><img src="/img/john-bike-trial-01.jpg" alt="john bike trial on rock ball" /></p>

<h4 id="how-long-have-you-been-eating-plant-based-foods-and-what-made-you-get-into-plant-foods">How long have you been eating plant based foods and what made you get into plant foods?</h4>
<p>I’ve been eating plant based foods my whole life (32yrs) as I was a vegetarian from a young age and went vegan around 12 years ago. My dad has always been a vegetarian and I just knew from an early age that I didn’t want to kill animals.</p>

<h4 id="do-you-like-making-food-and-what-are-your-favourite-foods">Do you like making food and what are your favourite foods?</h4>
<p>I like cooking when time allows however it can be a hassle on a standard week night when tired from work and wanting to fit in bike riding. So I like to make practical food like a nice big vegetable stew that will last me several days.</p>

<h4 id="describe-your-day-with-plant-foods">Describe your day with plant foods.</h4>
<p>On a typical work day:
Something naughty like vegan pain au chocolate or toast for breakfast, sometimes a healthy fruit smoothie. Naughty crisps or flapjack for a snack then sandwiches for lunch or something I can get out (often something from Currant Affairs if in town). Then if I’ve been organised I have some of my vegetable stew for dinner. My partner and I usually alternate who makes dinner and we often try new ideas when we have time.</p>

<h4 id="whats-your-favourite-kitchen-toolgadget">What’s your favourite kitchen tool/gadget?</h4>
<p>Our blender as it’s great for soups &amp; smoothies.</p>

<h4 id="what-one-food-could-you-not-live-without-and-which-food-do-you-miss-the-most-since-switching-to-plant-based-foods">What one food could you not live without and which food do you miss the most since switching to plant based foods?</h4>
<p>I don’t know if drinks count but I’d struggle to survive for long without tea (with soya milk).
I’ve been a vegan for so long that I really don’t have any desire for animal products. I often have vegan meats but I doubt I’d actually like the actual meat. When I first went vegan I remember really liking a type of soya cheese called Swedish Soft (by Winner who used to make Swedish Glace before Unilever took over).</p>

<h4 id="what-do-you-consider-the-most-important-foods-in-your-diet-and-why">What do you consider the most important foods in your diet and why?</h4>
<p>Hearty vegetables (potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, cabbage, kale etc.) and things like garlic and herbs for flavour and health. I’m unusual I suppose in that I like simple food, a healthy soup or stew and I’m happy. I don’t really go in for gourmet stuff much except for special occasions. I like to view food as fuel for the body and eat what’s healthy however I do have the odd weakness and limited time to cook.</p>

<h4 id="would-you-say-your-look-and-feel-more-healthy">Would you say your look and feel more healthy?</h4>
<p>It’s difficult to answer this one as I went vegan at the age of around 20 (12yrs ago) and although I do feel pretty healthy and strong I can’t compare to what I’d feel like if I’d been eating animal products all these years. I do think I’d be more overweight if I wasn’t a vegan as animal products tend to have more fat. I certainly don’t feel I lack anything and seem able to crash my bike without breaking bones.</p>

<h4 id="how-has-eating-plant-foods-changed-you">How has eating plant foods changed you?</h4>
<p>The food itself hasn’t really changed me however living in a way that is different to the other 99.5% does make you realise things such as how unsustainable animal products are and also how good people can do terrible things if they have been conditioned to believe it’s normal.</p>

<h4 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-someone-who-is-thinking-about-getting-into-plant-based-foods">What advice would you give to someone who is thinking about getting into plant based foods?</h4>
<p>Go for it. Going vegan is one of the best decisions I ever made J.</p>
