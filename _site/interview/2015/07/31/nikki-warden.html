<h4 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you">Who are you and what do you?</h4>

<p>Hi I am Nikki, a 23 year old apprentice. I work for my local council doing horticultural maintenance. However my heart truly lies in conservation which is what I hope to study at Nottingham University next September!</p>

<h4 id="how-long-have-you-been-eating-plant-based-foods-and-what-made-you-get-into-plant-foods">How long have you been eating plant based foods and what made you get into plant foods?</h4>
<p>I have been solely plant based since August 2014 and have never looked back! I originally went from vegetarian to almost vegan when I became intolerant to lactose. However since doing my research I now know there is no way I would every be able to consume animal product again as I know too much about the cruelty involved and also about the damaging effects these things have on ones health.</p>

<h4 id="do-you-like-making-food-and-what-are-your-favourite-foods">Do you like making food and what are your favourite foods?</h4>
<p>I love too cook but unfortunately I feel I currently do not have to time or space to do what I want to do in my kitchen. When I do cook I like to make things from scratch and add different ingredients as I go along, I never really cook with much of a plan! I just go with what tastes good!</p>

<h4 id="describe-your-day-with-plant-foods">Describe your day with plant foods.</h4>
<p>My day with plant foods starts with cereal topped with flax seed and fruit and a cup of earl grey! I will usually have a salad for lunch, I like salads with grains, beans and pulses in of some sort or I have a jacket potato! I will also have more fruit at lunch time! Dinner is whatever is in my fridge I usually have vegetable with either rice or gluten free pasta or potatoes, I also like stir frys!</p>

<h4 id="whats-your-favourite-kitchen-toolgadget">What’s your favourite kitchen tool/gadget?</h4>
<p>I would have to say my favorite tool is the knife my Dad gave to me, a J.A Henckels santoku! I literally use it for everything! But I’m pretty sure if I could afford to own a blendtec then that would be a sure fight for my favorite.</p>

<h4 id="what-one-food-could-you-not-live-without-and-which-food-do-you-miss-the-most-since-switching-to-plant-based-foods">What one food could you not live without and which food do you miss the most since switching to plant based foods?</h4>
<p>The one food I could not live without is avocado, they are so versatile! I would probably say I miss a cream tea the most but I know this can be recreated with soy clotted cream and vegan scone mix so if I stop being lazy and figure out how to make these things then I wont miss anything. I missed cheese for about 3 weeks but not anymore :)</p>

<h4 id="what-do-you-consider-the-most-important-foods-in-your-diet-and-why">What do you consider the most important foods in your diet and why?</h4>
<p>I like to try and eat in variety but I consider dark, leafy greens to be important and also nuts and grains.</p>

<h4 id="would-you-say-your-look-and-feel-more-healthy">Would you say your look and feel more healthy?</h4>
<p>Definitely, initially I lost a bit too much weight because I didn’t realize I needed to increase my portion size slightly but now I know what foods to eat and how much of them I have a lot more energy and my conscience is clear, my skin is also a lot clearer than it was too! Bonus lol</p>

<h4 id="how-has-eating-plant-foods-changed-you">How has eating plant foods changed you?</h4>
<p>I feel a lot more aware, I feel like the old me was so ignorant. Eating the way I eat now is so much simpler and just makes a lot more sense. I know now that whatever I’m eating I can’t really go far wrong!</p>

<h4 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-someone-who-is-thinking-about-getting-into-plant-based-foods">What advice would you give to someone who is thinking about getting into plant based foods?</h4>
<p>I would say probably to take little steps at a time, some people find any transition easier if it is gradual. However without knowing for what reason the person is thinking about it I cannot customize my advice. All I can say is it is the best thing I have ever done in my life and I wish I had been living my whole life plant based. Also it is not hard at all! Its soo soo easy and very eye opening. I think we vegans sometimes feel like we are walking around with this big secret to life but we want to share it with everyone! Good luck and take care :)</p>

<!-- Load libraries -->

// Place scripts to be loaded here, in the order the need to be executed

// Hammer uses, but customise this for your own needs.
// Notice the use of @path here. This is because we need the file names, 
// not the script tags being generated. Ensure all filenames you wish
// head.js to load are surrounded with quotes. Also, this is a list, so
// ensure that all but the last item are followed by a comma.
