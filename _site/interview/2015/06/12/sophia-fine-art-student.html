<h1 class="by">Sophia Fine Art Student</h1> 
<h2 class="by"><i>by</i> rajiv 12 June 2015</h2>
<p><em>New interviews will be posted here regularly. I’m hoping they offer you a glimse into the life of someone who eats only plant based foods and how different each person is and how they can inspire and help us into thinking differently, whether you are exclusively eating plant based foods or not.</em></p>

<h4 id="who-are-you-and-what-do-you-do">Who are you and what do you do?</h4>
<p>I am Sophia and I am a fine art student. I also work with adults with learning disabilities and I am a local coordinator for The Black Fish.</p>

<h4 id="how-long-have-you-been-eating-plant-based-foods-and-what-made-you-get-into-plant-foods">How long have you been eating plant based foods and what made you get into plant foods?</h4>
<p>I couldn’t bare the thought of eating a living thing as a child and stopped eating animals. I chose to abstain from animal products altogether at the age of 17 after watching Earthlings and realising that animals are born, abused and killed for more than just their flesh.</p>

<h4 id="do-you-like-making-food-and-what-are-your-favourite-foods">Do you like making food and what are your favourite foods?</h4>
<p>I love cooking! I make almost everything from scratch. My favourite treat is a cacao Raw Bite with a cup of fresh coffee.</p>

<h4 id="describe-your-day-with-plant-foods">Describe your day with plant foods.</h4>
<p>I eat in abundance. I make up a large batch of beans and legumes, rice and plenty of soaked seeds every evening and this makes up the base of 3 or 4 of my meals for the following day. My first meal is usually overnight oats made with almond milk, a good amount of chia or flaxseed, fruit and a side of tofu. I eat fruits, vegetables with dressing, nut and seed butters on rye bread or oat cakes, muesli and coconut oil throughout the day too!</p>

<h4 id="whats-your-favourite-kitchen-toolgadget">What’s your favourite kitchen tool/gadget?</h4>
<p>I don’t generally use any tools that are out of the ordinary! Occasionally I purchase a cheap hand held blender, but I am notoriously good at breaking them on frozen fruits!</p>

<h4 id="what-one-food-could-you-not-live-without-and-which-food-do-you-miss-the-most-since-switching-to-plant-based-foods">What one food could you not live without and which food do you miss the most since switching to plant based foods?</h4>
<p>I can’t isolate one food that I couldn’t live without! Perhaps celery spoons and jars of nut butter? The only thing I miss is a boiled egg and soldiers.</p>

<h4 id="what-do-you-consider-the-most-important-foods-in-your-diet-and-why">What do you consider the most important foods in your diet and why?</h4>
<p>All of the foods I eat have importance. I am an unofficial athlete and they all have a unique role in providing energy, focus, helping me to build and recover and in bringing me enjoyment.</p>

<h4 id="would-you-say-you-look-and-feel-more-healthy-and-how-has-eating-plant-foods-changed-you">Would you say you look and feel more healthy and how has eating plant foods changed you?</h4>
<p>I think it has made me more aware of my environmental footprint and more appreciative of whole foods and nature’s bounty. I do feel healthier than I did as a non-vegan. I don’t recall having a headache since I made the transition. I used to get regular migraines. I also consider myself a bit of an athlete now :) Sometimes it feels as though my cells are buzzing.</p>

<h4 id="what-advice-would-you-give-to-someone-who-is-thinking-about-getting-into-plant-based-foods">What advice would you give to someone who is thinking about getting into plant based foods.</h4>
<p>Do it. Eat whole foods in abundance and enjoy it :)</p>

<!-- Load libraries -->

// Place scripts to be loaded here, in the order the need to be executed
// Typically libraries are needed first, such as jQuery (as the plugins 
// depend on jQuery to execute). The below configuration is what Rock 
// Hammer uses, but customise this for your own needs.
// Notice the use of @path here. This is because we need the file names, 
// not the script tags being generated. Ensure all filenames you wish
// head.js to load are surrounded with quotes. Also, this is a list, so
// ensure that all but the last item are followed by a comma.

// Plugins
"/js/vendor/jquery/jquery.scrollTo.min.js",
