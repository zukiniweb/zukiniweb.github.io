					<h1>Leicester market</h1>
                        <p>If you live in Leicester or Leicestershire you have no excuse not to come visit Leicester market. You can buy some lovely fruit and veg at bargain prices. You just need to know a few things first.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Tuesday, Wednesday &amp; Friday are the best days</li>
                        <li>Walk around the market first before you buy anything</li>
                        <li>Buy produce that is mainly in season</li>
                        <li>Not all the stalls are in the same place each day</li>
                        <li>Some people run two stalls</li>
                        <li>These are my favourite stalls: Hills, Cottingham, Lunn’s, Garcia’s, Pittard’s &amp; Norton's </li>
                        <li>Don't help yourself unless it is clearly marked</li>
                        <li>In the summer the produce can ripen very quickly—so look carefully before you buy. If you are not sure ask the stall holder</li>
                        <li>Get to know the stall holders—it makes a huge difference</li>
                        <li>If you are concerned about whether to eat organic or not—have a look at the <a href="http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/index.php">The Dirty Dozen &amp; Clean Fifteen</a> to help you decide </li>

					<h1>Plant based eating</h1>
                                                <p>Having a plant based lifestyle does not need to be complicated. Most of it is common sense but then sometimes the most obvious things are not straightforward. I've created a simple guide to help you think about plant based eating. It's not a definitive guide—these are just my personal ideas on plant based foods. You can print this out and stick it on your wall. It will print to any size—it has been designed to print at A3.</p>

<h1>Food is fun</h1>
<p>I've solely been eating plant based foods for over 16 years. I've had a passion for eating natural foods for a very long time, I love experimenting with food. I enjoy yoga and massage, and I have lots of experience in both. My <a href="http://www.zerply.com/profile/yomojo/public">Zerply profile</a> has information about me.</p>
    <p>I've lived and worked in London for many years and ran a health food store there for several years, wholesaled fruit and veg—that I bought from New Covent Garden market. I've lived in France and ran a stall in the market making and selling food for a couple of years.</p>
    <p>Food—making and buying it has been a part of my life since I was a teenager, so I have lots of experience. Now I'm on my next part of this adventure.</p>
