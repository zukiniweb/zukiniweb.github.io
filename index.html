					<h1>Leicester market</h1>
                        <p>If you live in Leicester or Leicestershire you have no excuse not to come visit Leicester market. You can buy some lovely fruit and veg at bargain prices. You just need to know a few things first.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>Tuesday, Wednesday & Friday are the best days</li>
                        <li>Walk around the market first before you buy anything</li>
                        <li>Buy produce that is mainly in season</li>
                        <li>Not all the stalls are in the same place each day</li>
                        <li>Some people run two stalls</li>
                        <li>These are my favourite stalls: Hills, Cottingham, Lunn's, Garcia's, Pittard's & Norton's </li>
                        <li>Don't help yourself unless it is clearly marked</li>
                        <li>Get to know the stall holders—it makes a huge difference</li>
                        </ul>

					<h1>What's good this week</h1>
                                                <p>Summer fruit and veg has just started to come in. Lots of Spanish cherries, apricots and raspberries are available. Cherry tomatoes, herbs, spinach, broccoli, spring onions. Mangoes have been really good over the last few weeks. I think it's too early to buy good watermelon. There are English strawberries but I think they are grown in poly tunnels.</p>

<h1>Food is fun</h1>
<p>I've solely been eating plant based foods for over 16 years. I've had a passion for eating natural foods for a very long time, I love experimenting with food. I enjoy yoga and massage, and I have lots of experience in both. My <a href="http://www.zerply.com/profile/yomojo/public">Zerply profile</a> has information about me.</p>
    <p>I've lived and worked in London for many years and ran a health food store there for several years, wholesaled fruit and veg—that I bought from New Covent Garden market. I've lived in France and ran a stall in the market making and selling food for a couple of years.</p>
    <p>Food—making and buying it has been a part of my life since I was a teenager, so I have lots of experience. Now I'm on my next part of this adventure.</p>
