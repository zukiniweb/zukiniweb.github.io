#### Who are you and what do you?

Hi I am Nikki, a 23 year old apprentice. I work for my local council doing horticultural maintenance. However my heart truly lies in conservation which is what I hope to study at Nottingham University next September!

#### How long have you been eating plant based foods and what made you get into plant foods?
I have been solely plant based since August 2014 and have never looked back! I originally went from vegetarian to almost vegan when I became intolerant to lactose. However since doing my research I now know there is no way I would every be able to consume animal product again as I know too much about the cruelty involved and also about the damaging effects these things have on ones health. 

#### Do you like making food and what are your favourite foods?
I love too cook but unfortunately I feel I currently do not have to time or space to do what I want to do in my kitchen. When I do cook I like to make things from scratch and add different ingredients as I go along, I never really cook with much of a plan! I just go with what tastes good!

#### Describe your day with plant foods.
My day with plant foods starts with cereal topped with flax seed and fruit and a cup of earl grey! I will usually have a salad for lunch, I like salads with grains, beans and pulses in of some sort or I have a jacket potato! I will also have more fruit at lunch time! Dinner is whatever is in my fridge I usually have vegetable with either rice or gluten free pasta or potatoes, I also like stir frys!

#### What's your favourite kitchen tool/gadget?
I would have to say my favorite tool is the knife my Dad gave to me, a J.A Henckels santoku! I literally use it for everything! But I'm pretty sure if I could afford to own a blendtec then that would be a sure fight for my favorite.

#### What one food could you not live without and which food do you miss the most since switching to plant based foods?
The one food I could not live without is avocado, they are so versatile! I would probably say I miss a cream tea the most but I know this can be recreated with soy clotted cream and vegan scone mix so if I stop being lazy and figure out how to make these things then I wont miss anything. I missed cheese for about 3 weeks but not anymore :)

#### What do you consider the most important foods in your diet and why?
I like to try and eat in variety but I consider dark, leafy greens to be important and also nuts and grains.

#### Would you say your look and feel more healthy?
Definitely, initially I lost a bit too much weight because I didn't realize I needed to increase my portion size slightly but now I know what foods to eat and how much of them I have a lot more energy and my conscience is clear, my skin is also a lot clearer than it was too! Bonus lol

#### How has eating plant foods changed you?
I feel a lot more aware, I feel like the old me was so ignorant. Eating the way I eat now is so much simpler and just makes a lot more sense. I know now that whatever I'm eating I can't really go far wrong!

#### What advice would you give to someone who is thinking about getting into plant based foods?
I would say probably to take little steps at a time, some people find any transition easier if it is gradual. However without knowing for what reason the person is thinking about it I cannot customize my advice. All I can say is it is the best thing I have ever done in my life and I wish I had been living my whole life plant based. Also it is not hard at all! Its soo soo easy and very eye opening. I think we vegans sometimes feel like we are walking around with this big secret to life but we want to share it with everyone! Good luck and take care :)
