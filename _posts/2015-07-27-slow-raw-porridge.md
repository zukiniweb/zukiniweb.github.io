This has been my go to food for a long while and it's what I started ZUKINI with. During the recent National Vegetarian Week food demo at the Friends Meeting House it was a huge hit with everyone. What I really enjoy about it, is that's it's really simple to make.

A short video showing you how I make slow porridge for ZUKINI. This is as good or better than overnight porridge. It’s easy to make—just follow the instructions on the video. I flake my own oats using a cereal flaker but you can just use normal oats or whatever else you want to. The quantities are approximate but I used:

#### Slow raw porridge ingredients

* I cup of almond milk
* 1/4 cup of oats
* 3 medjool dates
* Small piece of vanilla bean
* 1tsp cacao powder
* 1 large apricot
* 1tbsp pumpkin seeds
* tsp coconut

It's fun but hard work making videos. I’d like to make some more similar videos, so let me know what you think—rajiv :)
