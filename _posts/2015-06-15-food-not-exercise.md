>Think about it this way: If an overweight man is consuming 1,000 more calories than he is burning and wants to be in energy balance, he can do it by exercising. But exercise consumes far fewer calories than many people think. Thirty minutes of jogging or swimming laps might burn off 350 calories. Many people, fat or fit, can&rsquo;t keep up a strenuous 30-minute exercise regimen, day in and day out. They might exercise a few times a week, if that.
