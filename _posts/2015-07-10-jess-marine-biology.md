#### Who are you and what do you do?

I'm Jess, a 25 year old Marine Biology graduate currently working in retail.

#### How long have you been eating plant based foods and what made you get into plant foods?

Over the past few years I've been getting more and more into health and realised how diet is crucial to our well-being. Around October time in 2014 I stumbled across some vegan YouTube videos and was fascinated by how vibrant and happy these people were. So I did some more research, found out how beneficial a plant based lifestyle is, along with the horrors of the meat, egg and dairy industry, and went vegan the following month. 

#### Do you like making food and what are your favourite foods?

I love cooking! I've become so much more experimental with my food since starting this lifestyle. My favourite food has to be bananas, I eat them every day.

#### Describe your day with plant foods.

Most mornings I have a big smoothie that is usually bananas, greens and some other fruits. Lunch I like to have a bowl of banana ice cream topped with berries, flaxseed etc. For dinner I'll have anything I fancy, such as home made pizza, veggie burgers, stir-fries or lasagne.

#### What's your favourite kitchen tool/gadget?

I have a three in one Kenwood that is a mixer, food processor and blender. It's amazing.

#### What one food could you not live without and which food do you miss the most since switching to plant based foods?

I couldn't live without my bananas. I don't really miss any foods these days, although when I first transitioned I found cheese the only thing I really missed, but I found vegan alternatives and don't crave it at all any more.

#### What do you consider the most important foods in your diet and why?

I don't consider any foods more important, a balance of different foods is most important to me.

#### Would you say your look and feel more healthy?

Yes, I noticed within a week of transitioning that I felt more healthy and alive.

#### How has eating plant foods changed you?

It's given me more energy, improved my mood and I feel much more aware of what I eat and where it has come from.

#### What advice would you give to someone who is thinking about getting into plant based foods.

Do your research and go for it! If you need advice there are so many people out there willing to help you!
