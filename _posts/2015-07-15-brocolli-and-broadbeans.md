Sometimes you have food that needs to be used up, or it's not possible to go shopping. A few weeks ago I need to make some food fairly quickly with whatever I had at home and also I had some very ripe apricots.

This made a meal full of lots of flavours—the ripe apricots really make this dish. It's really easy to make. It should not take you more than about 45 minutes to make this. If you have some ripe tomatoes and apricots why not try and make this dish or a variation of it?

#### Broccoli, broad beans & apricots ingredients

* A medium head of broccoli—cut into medium sized pieces
* 1 cup of broadbeans—you can use frozen
* 1/2 an onion
* A punnet of cherry tomatoes or equivalent
* Salt to taste
* Black pepper to taste
* Juice of one lemon
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper - this amount optional and you can omit it also
* 2 bay leaves
1 tbsp tahini
4 to 5 large fresh ripe apricots halved



#### Method

1. Chop the onions into fine slices
2. Place the chopped onions into a large pan and cook with a little water until they are translucent
3. Then add the cherry tomatoes and cook until they just start to burst
4. Add all the other ingredients except the, broadbeans, lemon, tahini and apricots, to the pan. You may need to add a bit of water but if you have enough tomatoes it should not be necessary
5. Cook until a sauce starts to form and then add the broadbeans and tahini—mix well. Keep stirring the mixture occasionally
6. Once the broadbeans begin to soften a little, add the apricots and stir gently. Cook for a little longer and then take the pan off the heat
7. Add the lemon juice and check the seasoning—adjust if necessary
8. The broccoli should be in one piece and not breaking up, the broadbeans tender and everything else nice and soft/mushy but whole—serve immediately

This is a substaintial meal—you could eat it on it's own (I did) or with quinoa, rice or a bread. Just depends on how hungry you are. Remember don't just eat with your eyes, otherwise you could end up eating too much!
