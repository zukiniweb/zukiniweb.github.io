Did you know that Leicester has over 60 vegetarian restaurants?
Leicester Vegetarian/Vegan Group have recently been working in collaboration with Leicester Shire [Promotions to promote the city as a Veggie Destination:](http://www.goleicestershire.com/food-and-drink/veggie-leicester.aspx)

Leicester is now the first place in the UK to offer a 'Veggie Vacation'. 
This consists of a one-night stay at a hotel, and the choice of 3/5 'veggie experiences' such as cocktail making and dinner at a local veggie restaurant. [Stay and explore Leicester](http://www.stayplayexplore.co.uk/vegetarianvacation2015.aspx)

We feel this is a great step forward for getting the vegan message more mainstream and giving people the chance to try veggie food for the first time. Note that at present its not 100% all vegan, but we are working to make that change for the future. The establishments involved in the holiday deal will be updated over time.

We are also involved in a local campaign to promote Leicester as the 'veggie capital of Europe' (see poster attached)
