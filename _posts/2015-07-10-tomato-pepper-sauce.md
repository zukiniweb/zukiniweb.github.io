Tomatoes, red peppers and onion—what could be more simple to make a rich flavourful versitile sauce? It’s simple to make and **it will keep for over a week**. This is what plant based living is about. This recipe is very forgiving and so you can vary the ingredients by a fair amount and it should still work—well that’s been my experience.

When you have lots of tomatoes, peppers and you don’t know what to do with them or maybe they are looking a bit tired—well what better way to use them! It’s a **super simple recipe** using basic ingredients and it should not take you more than 30 minutes from start to finish.

All you need to do is make some pasta, rice, beans or whatever and add some super delicous sauce. And a little sauce goes a long way! 

#### Tomato & red pepper sauce ingredients

* 3 punnets of tomatoes or equivalent
* 3 red peppers
* 1 onion
* 1 tbsp dried oregano
* 1 tsp salt - this amount is optional
* 1 tsp olive oil
* 3 tbsp apple cider vinegar
* Black pepper to taste
* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper - this amount optional and you can omit it also
3 tsp tahini
3 tsp date paste or maple syrup

#### Method

1. Chop everything roughly—if you’re using cherry tomatoes there is no need to chop them. Chop the onions finely
2. Place the chopped ingredients and everything else—leave half an onion for later, except the black pepper, cayenne pepper, tahini and date paste into a large pan. Don't worry if the pan is full, as you begin cooking it will reduce in volume
3. Mix everything and cook for about five minutes with the lid on and then stir everything again. Cook for another five minutes with the lid on
4. Empty the contents of the pan into a blender and blend until smooth—just make sure the blender jug can take hot liquids. You can use a stick blender
5. Put the sauce back into the pan, add the rest of the ingredients, mix well and cook for another five minutes.
6. Check the seasoning and let the sauce cool for a while. You can then bottle it

From the ingredients above I made about 2 ltr of sauce. It’s great for sharing—give some to family and friends. If you don’t want to make your own sauce then let me know and **I might offer it via Veggie Bite**.
