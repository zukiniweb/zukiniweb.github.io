This has been my go to food for a long while and it's what I started ZUKINI with. During the recent National Vegetarian Week food demo at the Friends Meeting House it was a huge hit with everyone. What I really enjoy about it, is that's it's really simple to make.

#### Almond milk ingredients

* 1/4 cup almonds
* Two to three dates (make sure they are pitted)
* 1/4 of a vanilla bean
* 3/4 cup of water

Put all the ingriedents into a blender and blend until everything is well blended. It should not take more than about a minute.

#### Fruit

You can use whatever fruit you like. For this particular one I used half of a large mango, half a punnet of rasberries and a passion fruit.

I put all the fruit into a bowl, topped it with a ground sesame and date mixture, and then poured the thick almond milk on top. You can also add things like, coconut strips, seeds, dried fruit. It's upto you what you want to add or not and that's what I really love about this---it's so versitile and you can just use what you have to hand.

I mixed everything together added some shredded coconut, goji berries and sunflower seeds.
