<p>The food is made from scratch for you, it’s made with heart and soul—it tastes delicious—<b>it’s is for everyone</b>.</p>
<p>Eating plant based foods does not mean you miss out on flavours and textures. The food is homemade, creative and not mass produced—<b>it’s slow food</b>.</p>

<p>Every part of what I do with ZUKINI is important, this includes how and what I use to make the food. All the food is made using stainless steel pots, a cast iron enamel Dutch oven or pans which are PFOA &amp; PTFE free. The cakes are made in bakeware that are PFOA &amp; PTFE free. Filtered water is used throughout using the Eva gravity water filter. Where possible organic ingredients are preferred and certain ingredients will always be organic - such as lettuce, celery and apples. Oil is used only when making the cakes, sauces and salads. I only use small amounts of organic virgin coconut or olive oil. I use organic Grey French sea salt in some of the foods and it's use is kept to a minimum.</p>
