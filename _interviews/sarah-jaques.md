*New interviews will be posted here regularly. I'm hoping they offer you a glimse into the life of someone who eats only plant based foods and how different each person is and how they can inspire and help us into thinking differently, whether you are exclusively eating plant based foods or not.*

#### Who are you and what do you do?
My name is Sarah I’m 19 years old and I’m an inspiring Nutritionist & adviser of the organic, wholesome and plant based lifestyle and I’m currently working my way towards that in all that I do. 

#### How long have you been eating plant based foods and what made you get into plant foods?
I’ve been 100% vegan for about a year now. I started off cutting down on my meat consumption for health reasons, eventually I was only eating fish and chicken and then I suddenly went off them. I eventually educated my self about vegan nutrition and the impact eating meat & dairy has on animal welfare and the planet. From that day I then knew going vegan was one of the best decisions I could make and I will always feel it’s the best decision I have ever made.

#### Do you like making food and what are your favourite foods?
I absolutely love eating & cooking with plants, I think about it all the time. I have so many favourites; I love fruit so much like mango, Medjool dates, bananas, apples and kiwis. My favourite vegan warm dish would probably be a nice wholesome curry or spaghetti with lentils, tomato sauce and veggies.

#### Describe your day with plant foods.
For breakfast I had a lovely banana smoothie, and for lunch/ snacks I’ve been eating loads of fruits like dates, mangoes and kiwis. Some days I eat RAW TILL 4 and then have a wholesome high carb dinner, like rice + veggies or sometimes I eat RAW TILL 12 and have a wholesome cooked lunched too.

#### What's your favourite kitchen tool/gadget?
At the moment I’m loving the blender to make my delicious smoothies, I also love my steamer, I know its simple but it makes my veggies taste so nice and it doesn’t boil away their nutrition.

#### What one food could you not live without and which food do you miss the most since switching to plant based foods?
FRUITS & VEGGIES, I couldn’t live without all of them and I miss no animal products at all, I’m too high on life with all the goodness plants bring.

#### What do you consider the most important foods in your diet and why?
Getting in my fruits & veggies in to feel nourished and eating enough carbs throughout the day to keep my energy up, it also ensures I don’t indulge on the high fat vegan foods which don’t agree with me if I have too much, for e.g. nut butters.

#### Would you say you look and feel more healthy and how has eating plant foods changed you?
MOST DEFINITELY, high energy, clearer skin, more or less the body shape I want (with exercise of course too) but yes definitely, you just give your body an abundance of nutrition from the right foods for you and you can only feel your best from it.

It’s opened my eyes to all the variety of plant based foods and the ethics that follow being plant based and overall it’s made me a more compassionate and considerate person for people, animals and the planet. I enjoy the simple things in life and I’m not wrapped up in a materialistic world.

#### What advice would you give to someone who is thinking about getting into plant based foods.
Be sure to research about plant based nutrition to make sure you are giving your body all that you need, try to avoid as much vegan junk as possible and stick to the wholesome foods like fruit, veg, legumes, whole-grains, nuts and seeds. It’s so much cheaper to make your food your self and it can be so simple (research). Make sure you eat enough too!! Overall enjoy the journey, follow vegan blogs, youtube channels, join vegan pages, people may be a bit negative around you but as long as you’re educated on veganism, following your beliefs and doing what makes you happy, that’s all that matters, there are so many people who have similar values that will support you in all that you do and I’m one of them. Always remember you have embarked on a great journey and I believe only positive things can come from this :)
